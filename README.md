# DevOps Interview Guide 🚀

Welcome to the **DevOps Interview Guide** – a public repository where I’ll be sharing real interview questions, answers, and personal experiences from my job switch journey as a DevOps & Cloud Engineer.

## 🎯 What to Expect

- ✅ Real interview questions (virtual + F2F)
- ✅ Sample answers & explanations
- ✅ Resume tips & Overleaf template
- ✅ Resources I personally used to prepare
- ✅ Interview questions on tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, CI/CD, Git, and more

## 📌 Why I Started This

After getting 4 offers (Accenture, IBM, Razorpay, and PalTech) with a 75–100% hike, I received a lot of DMs about my switch – so I decided to open up everything I learned and build this guide for everyone preparing for their first (or next!) DevOps role.

## 🤝 Contribute Your Experience
